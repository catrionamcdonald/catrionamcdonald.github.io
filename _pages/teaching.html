Work as a demonstrator for weekly lab sessions assisting eight students with various physics experiments. My work focusses on building students experimental skills alongside, lab book keeping and report writing skills.

**Tutor**, Explore Learning, Hounslow, UK (2016-2017)
------
In my role at Explore Learning, I frequently tutored up to 6 children (aged 5-14) at a time, helping them with maths and English skills. This role increased my ability to manage time effectively and keep track of work loads, as the children can be quite demanding at times. I also increased my ability to work with people of all ages and conduct my self in an appropriate manner for all ages. Frequent staff training allowed me to keep up to date with new teaching methods and how to embody the values of Explore Learning.
