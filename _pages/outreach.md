**Planetarium Volunteer**, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK (2019 - present)
As a volunteer I accompany the university's inflatable planetarium to local schools and present shows to groups of various aged children. 

**SEPnet Outreach Ambassador**, Royal Holloway, University of London, UK (2017-2019)
As an outreach ambassador I assisted at outreach events such as public lectures and science fairs. This included discussing topics within Physics to members of the public of all ages, and running demonstrations to aid understanding of these topics. Communication with both academics and the public was vital alongside managing my own areas of an event to keep it running smoothly.

**Ogden Trust Summer Intern**, Royal Holloway, University of London, UK (2018)
I worked closely with my department’s Outreach Officer, Anna Christodoulou, to create a prototype ticket booking app for use at outreach events throughout the university. I created a mobile web app using JavaScript, HTML5 and Google’s Firebase Realtime Database product. This project involved independent study and work to achieve the aims discussed and planned with my supervisor during weekly meetings. At the end of the project I was nominated for the Trust’s Outstanding Intern award.

**Outreach work experience**, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK (2014)
I worked with Professor Andrew Norton to create interactive outreach resources detailing the creation and science behind the upcoming LSST and PLATO projects. The resources were created using the IntuiFace software, which allowed the creation of an interactive 'PowerPoint' style presentation, where uses could navigate through various screens giving information about the motivation and progress of the projects.
Through this project I developed research skills as well as learning how to use the software IntuiFace, and have the pride of knowing a project I worked on is regularly used at outreach exhibitions around the country.
