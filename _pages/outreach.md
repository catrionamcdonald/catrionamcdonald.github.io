**International Women's Day Schools Outreach**, University of Cambridge, UK (March 2024)
------
I was a member of the organising committee for a suite of events organised to celebrate International Women's Day. The celebration included inviting students from local underserved schools to attend the Institute of Astronomy and take part in activities designed to encourage an interest in science, a departmental event celebrating unseen achievments and a panel discussion for undergraduate students. My main contribution to this event was devising and producing resources for a new outreach activity 'A Journey through the Solar System' which aimed to get students thinking about different environments throughout the Solar System and how we design spacecraft in order to explore them. The activity was attended by 120 school students across two days. 

**Co-Chair of Outreach Organising Committee**, National Astronomy Meeting 2022, Warwick, (2020-2022)
------
With Dr. R. Nealon, devised and organised a four day outreach program including school visits, a science festival, art exhibition, streamed panel discussion and film screening with associated foreword. 
To complete these activities we fundraised over £20,000, managed a group of over 20 volunteers and subsequently were able to reach an audience of over 1000 people. 

**Planetarium Volunteer**, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK (2019 - present)
------
As a volunteer I accompany the university's inflatable planetarium to local schools and present shows to groups of various aged children. 

**Pint of Science Volunteer**, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK (2019-2020)
-----
Volunteered to help organise the content for Pint of Science 2020. Was involved with choosing the presentors and organising the programme. The in person festival was cancelled due to Covid-19, but I acted as a moderator for the Pint of Science Live Online event *Ctrl-Alt-Del: Are We Living In A Simulation?*.

**SEPnet Outreach Ambassador**, Royal Holloway, University of London, UK (2017-2019)
------
As an outreach ambassador I assisted at outreach events such as public lectures and science fairs. This included discussing topics within Physics to members of the public of all ages, and running demonstrations to aid understanding of these topics. Communication with both academics and the public was vital alongside managing my own areas of an event to keep it running smoothly.

**Ogden Trust Summer Intern**, Royal Holloway, University of London, UK (2018)
------
I worked closely with my department’s Outreach Officer, Anna Christodoulou, to create a prototype ticket booking app for use at outreach events throughout the university. I created a mobile web app using JavaScript, HTML5 and Google’s Firebase Realtime Database product. This project involved independent study and work to achieve the aims discussed and planned with my supervisor during weekly meetings. At the end of the project I was nominated for the Trust’s Outstanding Intern award.

**Outreach work experience**, Open University, Milton Keynes, UK (2014)
------
I worked with Professor Andrew Norton to create interactive outreach resources detailing the creation and science behind the upcoming LSST and PLATO projects. The resources were created using the IntuiFace software, which allowed the creation of an interactive 'PowerPoint' style presentation, where uses could navigate through various screens giving information about the motivation and progress of the projects.
Through this project I developed research skills as well as learning how to use the software IntuiFace, and have the pride of knowing a project I worked on is regularly used at outreach exhibitions around the country.
