Plan: 

Homepage: index.html
  - simple as is

When and Where: when-where.html
  - contain details about where the venue is
  - when to arrive etc
  - timings for the day 
  - details about the reception 

Accommodation: accomm.html
  - information about local hotels
  - explicitly say about there being limited rooms at the venue so
    unless we have contacted you explicity, don't ask 

Dress code: dress.html
  - smart casual?
  - we want everyone to feel comfortable and look their best?

Gifts: gift.html
  - we do not expect gifts because we have everything we need (love!)
  - but if you would absolutely love to give us a gift, a contribution to 
    our house/honeymoon fund would be amazing.
